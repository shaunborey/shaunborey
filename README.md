### Senior Software Developer

I am a senior-level full stack developer with over 15 years of experience developing large-scale distributed web applications primarily on the Microsoft stack built upon a C#.Net backend.

I also have extensive experience working with SQL Server and utilizing T-SQL to write complex stored procedures and some minor experience with other languages such as Java and Python. I am passionate about leveraging my skills to find solutions to complex business problems.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I discovered my love for software development by accident. Years ago, a friend started a small business and, since she knew that I knew a little about computers, "volun-told" me to build her one. I didn't know how to do that but decided to give it a shot. I taught myself HTML and Javascript along with ASP 3.0/VBScript and SQL Server databases. I quickly fell in love with creating web applications because it allowed me to use my creativity, intellect, and passion for puzzle-solving all at once. Since those days, I have made software development utilizing the Microsoft stack my full-time career.
